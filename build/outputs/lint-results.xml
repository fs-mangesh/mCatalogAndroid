        category="Correctness"

        summary="Implied default locale in case conversion"
        explanation="Calling `String#toLowerCase()` or `#toUpperCase()` *without specifying an explicit locale* is a common source of bugs. The reason for that is that those methods will use the current locale on the user&apos;s device, and even though the code appears to work correctly when you are developing the app, it will fail in some locales. For example, in the Turkish locale, the uppercase replacement for `i` is *not* `I`.

If you want the methods to just perform ASCII replacement, for example to convert an enum name, call `String#toUpperCase(Locale.US)` instead. If you really want to use the current locale, call `String#toUpperCase(Locale.getDefault())` instead."

        explanation="This check ensures that a layout resource which is defined in multiple resource folders, specifies the same set of widgets.

This finds cases where you have accidentally forgotten to add a widget to all variations of the layout, which could result in a runtime crash for some resource configurations when a `findViewById()` fails.

There *are* cases where this is intentional. For example, you may have a dedicated large tablet layout which adds some extra widgets that are not present in the phone version of the layout. As long as the code accessing the layout resource is careful to handle this properly, it is valid. In that case, you can suppress this lint check for the given extra or missing views, or the whole layout"

        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Calling new methods on older versions"
        explanation="This check scans through all the Android API calls in the application and warns about any calls that are not available on *all* versions targeted by this application (according to its minimum SDK attribute in the manifest).

If you really want to use this API and don&apos;t need to support older devices just set the `minSdkVersion` in your `build.gradle` or `AndroidManifest.xml` files.

If your code is *deliberately* accessing newer APIs, and you have ensured (e.g. with conditional execution) that this code will only ever be called on a supported platform, then you can annotate your class or method with the `@TargetApi` annotation specifying the local minimum SDK to apply, such as `@TargetApi(11)`, such that this check considers 11 rather than your manifest file&apos;s minimum SDK as the required API level.

If you are deliberately setting `android:` attributes in style definitions, make sure you place this in a `values-vNN` folder in order to avoid running into runtime conflicts on certain devices where manufacturers have added custom attributes whose ids conflict with the new ones on later platforms.

Similarly, you can use tools:targetApi=&quot;11&quot; in an XML file to indicate that the element will only be inflated in an adequate context."

This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly.

        category="Security"
        priority="3"
        summary="AllowBackup/FullBackupContent Problems"
        explanation="The `allowBackup` attribute determines if an application&apos;s data can be backed up and restored. It is documented at http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup

By default, this flag is set to `true`. When this flag is set to `true`, application data can be backed up and restored by the user using `adb backup` and `adb restore`.

This may have security consequences for an application. `adb backup` allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. `adb restore` allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.

Setting `allowBackup=&quot;false&quot;` opts an application out of both backup and restore.

To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup, and explicitly set `android:allowBackup=(true|false)&quot;`.

If not set to false, and if targeting API 23 or later, lint will also warn that you should set `android:fullBackupContent` to configure auto backup."

        summary="Using left/right instead of start/end attributes"
        explanation="Using `Gravity#LEFT` and `Gravity#RIGHT` can lead to problems when a layout is rendered in locales where text flows from right to left. Use `Gravity#START` and `Gravity#END` instead. Similarly, in XML `gravity` and `layout_gravity` attributes, use `start` rather than `left`.

For XML attributes such as paddingLeft and `layout_marginLeft`, use `paddingStart` and `layout_marginStart`. *NOTE*: If your `minSdkVersion` is less than 17, you should add *both* the older left/right attributes *as well as* the new start/right attributes. On older platforms, where RTL is not supported and the start/right attributes are unknown and therefore ignored, you need the older left/right attributes. There is a separate lint check which catches that type of error.

(Note: For `Gravity#LEFT` and `Gravity#START`, you can use these constants even when targeting older platforms, because the `start` bitmask is a superset of the `left` bitmask. Therefore, you can use `gravity=&quot;start&quot;` rather than `gravity=&quot;left|start&quot;`.)"
